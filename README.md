# Wireframing

## Introduction to Wireframing
Wireframing is the process of creating a visual blueprint of a digital product.  
It helps designers and developers plan structure and usability before coding begins.  

## Key Elements of Wireframing
- **Layout Structure**: Defines the overall arrangement of elements on the screen.  
- **Navigation**: Shows how users move through the interface.  
- **Content Placement**: Indicates where text, images, and media will appear.  
- **Functionality**: Represents actions like buttons, forms, and interactions.  

## Types of Wireframes
- **Low-Fidelity Wireframes**: Simple sketches used in early brainstorming stages.  
- **High-Fidelity Wireframes**: Detailed designs used closer to development.  

This is a **Low-Fidelity Wireframe** since it focuses on structure, not visuals.  

## Wireframing Tools
Popular tools include Balsamiq, Adobe XD, and Sketch.  
**Figma** is highly recommended for its collaboration, prototyping, and ease of use.  

## Benefits of Wireframing in Software Development
Wireframes clarify design ideas and guide development early in the process.  
They also improve team communication by providing a shared visual reference.  

## Wireframing in Practice
In an e-commerce project, wireframing revealed confusing navigation paths.  
Fixing them improved checkout flow, ensuring a smooth and user-friendly design.
